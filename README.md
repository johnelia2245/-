<h3>In today’s world, teaching children programming helps develop their imagination and strengthens their problem-solving skills. Coding is not just a technical skill; it allows kids to move from simply using technology to creating and shaping it. By learning how to communicate with computers, they build creativity, persistence, and the ability to turn their ideas into reality.
